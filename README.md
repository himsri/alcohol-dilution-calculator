# alcohol-dilution-calculator
A streamlit app that simplifies the alcohol dilution process and output volume. Enter the volume of water and alcohol (in milliliters) you want to mix, along with the room temperature (in degrees Celsius). We'll calculate the final solution volume, considering potential volume contraction when mixing water and alcohol.
